# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various property features. The goal is to demonstrate a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

The project is implemented in Python using commonly used data science and machine learning libraries.


## Project Overview

Accurate house price prediction is a common real-world problem in real estate and finance. In this project, a supervised learning approach is used to estimate house prices by learning patterns from historical data.

The emphasis of this project is on:
- Proper data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling categorical variables using encoding techniques  
- Training and evaluating a regression model

## Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Library:** scikit-learn  

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.


## Workflow Summary

1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values  
3. Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding  
4. Train-test split  
5. Model training using Linear Regression  
6. Generating predictions and evaluating results
